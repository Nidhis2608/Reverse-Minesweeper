Reversed Minesweeper

A Flutter-based board game where players place pieces on a 10x10 grid while avoiding hidden bombs.

🎮 Gameplay

Drag and drop pieces onto free squares.

Dropping on bombs reveals them and increases the counter.

Every 10 seconds, a random bomb explodes automatically.

Game ends when all bombs are discovered or exploded, showing total bombs found.
